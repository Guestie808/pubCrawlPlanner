# Project Proposal
Pub Crawl Planner

## Business Case


### Problem statement
- HTML web based app used to plan a Pub Crawl for young and middle aged adults, with additional features to try and make the pub crawl more interesting and hassle free.
- Attempting to solve the problem that many new residents of Bristol may have; finding new pubs/ nightclubs to visit with friends.

### Business benefits
- Provides easier way to organise a night out, encouraging exploration of local areas, espeicially to people new to the city.
- Offers additional features to help make a night out more enjoyable such as activities, challenges, forfeits, etc.
- Smaller pubs gaining brand awareness and potentially earning long-term customer loyalty
- Helps organise when and where live music/ other events are taking place

### Options Considered
- BarCrawl: https://www.barcrawl.co.uk/
    + Range of cities to choose from (low relevance as limited to Bristol Dataset)
    + Embedded google maps view
        - Issues with embed not showing correct pub locations
    + Ability to save crawl after login
    + Can view existing pubs crawls created by other users
    - Unfriendly UI
    - Limited to number of pubs, cant do time limit
    - Issues generating the crawl intself: not generating all requested pubs crawl

- DayTrips: https://www.daytrips.ai/pub-crawl
    + AI meaning large amount of data at its disposal
    + Allows users to tailor their crawl to their prefered drink
        - Can only select prefered drinks from different types of beers
    + Includes both time spent out and number of pubs to visit
    + Suggests time spent at each location
    + Generates GoogleMaps embed with route plotted out
    + Links to each pub included with descriptions of each too
    - Cant select specific starting location or general location: limited to city

- Vondy: https://www.vondy.com/pub-crawl-generator--lVUgFVhf


### Expected Risks
- Laws involving drinking
- Time restraints
- Limited experience using HTML and JavaScript
- Only so much data that can be extracted from the dataset, limiting final outcome of the project
